# Installing and Testing

Right now our preprocessor folder looks like this.

```bash
$ tree
.
└── foliant
    └── preprocessors
        └── gibberish.py

2 directories, 1 file
```

To make it an installable Python package we need to add a `setup.py` file to the root folder.

Here's an [article on creating setup files](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html) from the official docs. Usually, we just take one of the `setup.py`s from an existing preprocessor as a template or use this official Foliant [snippet](https://github.com/foliant-docs/foliantcontrib.templates.preprocessor/blob/develop/setup.py).

Here's what your `setup.py` may look like.

```python
from setuptools import setup


SHORT_DESCRIPTION = 'Gibberish preprocessor for Foliant.'  # [*]

try:
    with open('README.md', encoding='utf8') as readme:
        LONG_DESCRIPTION = readme.read()

except FileNotFoundError:
    LONG_DESCRIPTION = SHORT_DESCRIPTION


setup(
    name='foliantcontrib.gibberish',  # [*]
    description=SHORT_DESCRIPTION,
    long_description=LONG_DESCRIPTION,
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
    version='1.0.0',
    author='Simon Garfunkel',  # [*]
    author_email='simong@example.com',  # [*]
    url='https://github.com/foliant-docs/foliantcontrib.gibberish',  # [*]
    packages=['foliant.preprocessors'],
    license='MIT',
    platforms='any',
    install_requires=[
        'foliant>=1.0.8',
    ],
    classifiers=[
        "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable",
        "Environment :: Console",
        "Intended Audience :: Developers",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
        "Programming Language :: Python",
        "Topic :: Documentation",
        "Topic :: Utilities",
    ]
)
```

Lines marked with asterisks you would probably want to change to suit your preprocessor. Also, note that we referred to the contents of the `README.md` as the full description of the package. It's a good time to add a readme for your preprocessor. Explain what your preprocessor does and what options it has. You may use one of the official preprocessors for possible readme structure.

Now the folder structure should look like this

```bash
$ tree
.
├── foliant
│ └── preprocessors
│     └── gibberish.py
├── README.md
└── setup.py

2 directories, 3 files
```

Time to test if the preprocessor actually works. First, install it by running this command inside the preprocessor folder.

```bash
$ pip3 install .
```

Create an empty Foliant project using the `init` command:

```bash
$ foliant init  # creating the empty project
Enter the project name: Gibberish Test

├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── foliant.yml
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── src
    └── index.md

1 directory, 6 files
```

First, let's add our preprocessor to the `foliant.yml`.

```diff
title: Gibberish Test

+ preprocessors:
+   - gibberish
+
chapters:
  - index.md
```

Now let's edit the `index.md` and use the `<gibberish><gibberish>` tag a few times.

```html
# Welcome to Gibberish Test

Here's some gibberish:

<gibberish></gibberish>

Here are just two sentences of gibberish:

<gibberish size="2"></gibberish>
```

Let's build our project into the `pre` target. This target doesn't create a PDF or a DOCX, it just returns the preprocessed Markdown text, which perfectly suits our testing needs.

```bash
$ foliant make pre   
Parsing config... Done
Applying preprocessor gibberish... Done
Applying preprocessor _unescape... Done
────────────────────
Result: Gibberish_Test-2021-08-16.pre
```

Inspect the results

```
$ cat Gibberish_Test-2021-08-16.pre/index.md 
# Welcome to Gibberish Test

Here's some gibberish:

Yxz izyuo sjo iir tewo qvqc etosaeeuo iecaizaso aaeoeuo iyey. Apavaiqfu eqaaa eecyo ioiiyuoay ah caou iets. Yooyofa iiynndea yiuqehlq uizu yca. Pi iuld ixuaeqei ousogp yu ushggxyq yiia uiuyjo.

Here are just two sentences of gibberish:

Lof peuoy iiouy yyau qggedo evuoucaig. Pziqgsg ekiqepyu laeiridyc.
```

Looks like everything worked fine. Now let's set the `default_size` parameter to check if preprocessor options work too. Edit the `foliant.yml`

```diff
title: Gibberish Test

preprocessors:
-   - gibberish
+   - gibberish:
+       default_size: 1

chapters:
  - index.md

```

And run the build

```bash
$ foliant make pre   
Parsing config... Done
Applying preprocessor gibberish... Done
Applying preprocessor _unescape... Done
────────────────────
Result: Gibberish_Test-2021-08-16.pre
```

Now the first `<gibberish></gibberish>` tag should be replaced with just one line of text. Let's check that

```
cat Gibberish_Test-2021-08-16.pre/index.md
# Welcome to Gibberish Test

Here's some gibberish:

Jy si zhwtyu acneec qeugeya ax qqofaiu ydyyyxz.

Here are just two sentences of gibberish:

Wnuhocx uqny ns. Iu ieuiaea iogyjyfy kl eyyeex agayii aioaac yacjume.
```

Everything works as expected. Now you can add a `LICENSE` and a `changelog.md` to your preprocessor folder and publish it in GitHub and pypi, so that others could use your wonderful creation too!

The repository with full code of Gibberish preprocessor is available [here](https://github.com/foliant-docs/preprocessor_tutorial).

# Summary

Now you know the basics of creating preprocessors for Foliant. But there's a lot more to learn! Study the code of different preprocessors created by our team to find out different approaches to solving techwriters' problems. Refer to the <link src="!path src/dev_reference.md"></link> for all helper functions, classes and their attributes available for building Foliant extensions.

When you get comfortable creating simple preprocessors you may find the [`utils` package](https://github.com/foliant-docs/foliantcontrib.utils) useful. It contains different tools which perform common tasks in preprocessors like [dealing with the `chapters` section](https://github.com/foliant-docs/foliantcontrib.utils/blob/master/docs/chapters.md) in foliant.yml or efficiently [combining options](https://github.com/foliant-docs/foliantcontrib.utils/blob/master/docs/combined_options.md) from foliant.yml and XML tags. There's also a powerful [`BasePreprocessorExt` class](https://github.com/foliant-docs/foliantcontrib.utils/blob/master/docs/preprocessor_ext.md) which encapsulates some boilerplate code for your preprocessors and offers advanced tools for warnings output and more.

That's all for now. We wish you luck in extending Foliant! Send us a message if you want your preprocessor included in the official Foliant docs.
