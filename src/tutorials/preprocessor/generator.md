# Creating the Gibberish Generator

There are already several Python packages present on PyPi which generate placeholder texts like [loremipsum](https://github.com/monkeython/loremipsum) but we won't deprive ourselves of the fun of creating our own.

Let's define some requirements:

- The generated text should consist of sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a dot.
- There should be a way of controlling the size of the sentence and the number of sentences in the resulting text.
- The words in the text should have at least a slight resemblance with real language words.

The last requirement is a bit tricky: we don't want words like `q` or `zxd` in our text, or at least not too many of those, so that the text looks a bit more real. So what we will do is create a simple `gen_word` function which will generate a word with a random number of letters, but the letters will be picked in a more controlled way by another function called `pick_letter`:

```python
from random import randint

def gen_word():
    word_len = randint(2, 9)  # [1]
    return ''.join(pick_letter() for _ in range(word_len))  # [2]
```

1. We've restricted the length of the words to 2 to 9 letters so we could avoid too short and too long words.
2. The `pick_letter` function will be supplying us with random letters.

Now to the `pick_letter` function. To make the words look real we don't want this function to return too many of the letters q, w, x and z, which don't appear in the words often. We also want to get more vowels than consonants: `kiobe` looks more like a word than `lknsd`.

Here's one way to do it

```python
from random import choice, random

def pick_letter():
    rare_letters = 'qwxz'
    vowels = 'aeiouy'
    consonants = 'cdfghjklmnprstv'

    pick = random()  # [1]
    if pick > 0.9:  # [2]
        return choice(rare_letters) # [3]
    elif pick > 0.25: # [4]
        return choice(vowels) # [5]
    else:
        return choice(consonants) # [6]
```

1. Get a random float number from the [`random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.random) function.
2. Since `random` returns a float from 0.0 to 1.0, there's about a 10% chance of getting a float that is larger than 0.9.
3. In this case, we will randomly pick one of the rare letters: q, w, x, or z with the [`choice`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice) function.
4. The chance of getting a float between 0.25 and 0.9 is about 65%.
5. In this case, we will return a vowel.
6. Finally, with a chance of about 25%, we will be returning one of the remaining consonants.

Let's put it all together and test our `gen_word` function

```python
>>> gen_word()
'eojuo'
>>> gen_word()
'soe'
>>> gen_word()
'qwiim'
>>> gen_word()
'itookao'
```

Oh my god, I think we've just created the Finnish language! Jokes aside, it seems that our words generator works fine.

Now we need to create functions for generating sentences and putting them together in a text.

```python
def gen_sentence(num_words=7):  # [1]
    words = (gen_word() for _ in range(num_words))  # [2]
    return ' '.join(words).capitalize()  # [3]
```

1. The number of words in the sentence is determined by the `num_words` parameter with a sensible default of 7 words.
2. Creating a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions) that will yield a new word a required number of times.
3. Joining the generated words into a single string, separated by spaces. We are also making the first word capitalized in our sentence.

A quick test to make sure it works

```python
>>> gen_sentence()
'Oveecyyi tukzgoli zvo uqyi ujiffrl viivu odui'
>>> gen_sentence(3)
'Ioyieyug ie hkeepnyo'
```

And now to the whole text generator

```python
def gen_text(num_sentences=10):  # [1]
    sizes = (randint(3, 12) for _ in range(num_sentences))  # [2]
    sentences = (gen_sentence(size) for size in sizes)  # [3]
    return '. '.join(sentences) + '.'  # [4]
```

1. The text generator will accept one parameter `num_sentences` with a default of 10.
2. Creating a generator that will yield a number of words in each sentence a required number of times. We are limiting the sentence size here to 3 to 12 words.
3. Creating a generator that will yield a new sentence a required number of times.
4. Joining the generated sentences into a single string, separated by dots. We are also adding a dot at the end of the text.

Time for the final test!

```python
>>> gen_text()
'Eeaidmt cznm aeoiemino ivjuyauq exieh aoioayif yavfkoa tasojm xuz qizxiyum iyoi fajo. Anuipcauo uac eunjtou oiy hougqf tulztiawk qooulu eiewewaii.

>>> gen_text(2)
'Uyayu xpriicoe usao yua duleekayi loqk iop saiy iuys sciyaihs. Onacrtog ual iei nuuoaz gdgia yyoui.'
```

Our gibberish generator turned out quite decent. Now it's time to make it a Foliant preprocessor.
