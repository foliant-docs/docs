# Welcome to Foliant!

Foliant is a all-in-one documentation authoring tool. It lets you produce standalone documents in pdf and docx, as well as websites, from single Markdown source.

Foliant is a higher order tool, which means it uses other programs to do its job. For pdf and docx, it uses [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), for websites it uses [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

Foliant preprocessors let you include parts of documents in other documents, show and hide content with flags, render diagrams from text, and much more.

## Who Is It for?

You’ll love Foliant if you:

- need to ship documentation as pdf, docx, and website forms
- want to use Markdown with consistent extension system instead of custom syntax for every new bit of functionality
- like reStructuredText’s extensibility and Asciidoc’s flexibility, but actually would rather use Markdown
- want a tool that you can actually write custom extensions for without dealing with something as overengineered as Sphinx
- have documentation spread across many repos and want to reuse parts between documents
