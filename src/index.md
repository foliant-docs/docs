# Welcome to Foliant!

Foliant is an all-in-one single-source documentation authoring tool. It lets you produce standalone documents in **pdf** and **docx**, build **static websites** and upload pages to **Confluence**, all from single Markdown source.

Foliant is a higher order tool, which means it uses other programs to do its job. For building pdf and docx, it can use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or [md-to-pdf](https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf), for websites [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio) or [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate).

Foliant preprocessors let you reuse parts of your documents, show and hide content with flags, render diagrams from text, and much more.

Foliant is highly extensible, so if it lacks some functions or output formats you can always make a plugin for it or request one from our team.

## Who Is It for?

You’ll love Foliant if you:

* need to ship documentation as pdf, docx, and websites
* want to use Markdown with consistent extension system instead of custom syntax for every new bit of functionality
* like reStructuredText’s extensibility and AsciiDoc’s flexibility, but would rather use Markdown
* want a tool that you can extend with custom plugins without dealing with something as over-engineered as Sphinx
* want to work with docs as code and make them a part of your CI pipeline
* have a lot of segregated repositories with sources of your documents and want to standardize the documentation approach.
