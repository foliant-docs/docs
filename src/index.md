# Welcome to Foliant!

**Foliant** is documentation tool empowered with single-source publishing. Made possible by using external services.

Deliver your docs to

- Markdown;
- pdf with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or [md-to-pdf](https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf);
- docx;
- static websites as [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio) or [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate);
- Confluence pages.

Every layout form and function is implemented in preprocessors - Foliant instructions for 3rd party apps. That's why be creative and

- reuse docs;
- flag and restrict content;
- draw diagrams from text;
- build extensions on demand or request one from our team;
- make docs, as you imagine.

## Why Foliant?

You gain unlimited options to

* code your docs;
* store them as Markdown basic texts;
* ship right away in preferred form;
* extend with simple scripts;
* decentralise repositories and direct them into single source.
